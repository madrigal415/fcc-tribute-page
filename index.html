        This guy spent his life caring for children. He treated children, and time and again he found himself caring for children poisoned by lead. Recognizing the problem, he became one of the first to study the effects from low-level exposures. His study examined lead in children's teeth and found that higher levels were linked to lower IQ scores. His research contributed to regulations that removed lead from gasoline and paint. After these regulations went into place lead levels plummeted.
